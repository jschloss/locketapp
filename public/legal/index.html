            <h1>Locket Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="large">This is a legally binding contract between you and Locket. By downloading Locket, you indicate that you agree to be bound by this contract. Please make sure you read it, because Locket deals with important stuff like security and providing access to your computer. We’ve tried to make this document as clear as possible, but there's some unavoidable legal mumbo jumbo. We welcome your feedback to <a href="mailto:help@locketapp.com">help@locketapp.com</a> if you have suggestions or questions.</p>
            <h1>Definitions</h1>
            <p>We’re going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read. When we say “Locket,” we mean the functionality provided by using both Locket for iPhone and Locket for Mac, apps offered through the iOS App Store and Locketapp.com, respectively. When we say “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Locket Inc., a Delaware corporation. When we say “your iPhone's data,” we mean any and all information stored on your iPhone and accessible via open iOS APIs. When we say "your Mac's data," we mean any and all information stored on your Mac and accessible by a user account with administrator privileges. When we say "our site," we mean www.locketapp.com. And when we say “terms,” we mean these terms of service.</p>
            <h1>Accepting these terms</h1>
            <p>Please read these terms before using Locket. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not download and use Locket. If we make material changes to these terms, we’ll let you know via Locket for iPhone app update notes and at this URL. If you do not agree to those changes, you must stop using Locket immediately. If we do not hear from you within ten days, the revised terms will apply to you. We're sorry if this sounds harsh, but we're serious about keeping your data safe.</p>
            <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
            <p>When you download and install Locket, we may store some publicly available information about you, such as your browser type, operating system type, and estimated geographic location. We may also share this information with third-party services like Google Analytics or Kissmetrics, so we can learn more about how you use our site and improve that experience.</p>

            <p>We may be required to disclose this information in order to:

                comply with the law or legal process;
                protect or defend our rights or property, or the rights or property of others;
                enforce these terms.</p>

                <p>We will also aggregate user information and perform statistical analyses of the collective behavior of Locket users and visitors to our site, to measure overall demographics, and to analyze how to improve our product. We may share this information with third parties (such as Google Analytics), but such aggregate information does not contain personal information other than IP addresses and the type of devices you are using. In addition, we may compile and disclose aggregate information about our users for promotional or other purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain percentage of our users are located within a particular geographic area or use Locket more than 20 times a day.</p>

                <p>We use cookies to help keep track of when a person has visited our site more than once. We use this information to improve our site's user experience for returning visitors.</p>

                <p>Locket sometimes accesses your iPhone's data, but we will never share this information. We use iPhone's core location API to intermittently monitor and record your GPS location to improve the Locket user experience. While we do record and save this data locally on your iPhone to make it available to our algorithms designed to save battery life, we will not share it with third parties. 
                </p>
                <h1>Disclaimer of warranties</h1>
                <p>We genuinely believe that for the vast majority of users, Locket is a safer way to authorize with your Mac than using a password alone. That said, we disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not make any warranty that Locket will protect your Mac or your Mac's data. You understand that you use Locket at your own discretion and risk. We think this is only fair.</p>
                <h1>Limitations of liability</h1>
                <p>Under no circumstances — including, without limitation, negligence — shall we be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, including loss or theft of your iPhone, your Mac, or your Mac's data, resulting from the use of or the inability to use Locket.</p>
                <p>You understand that Locket doesn't replace the password as the method of authentication for your Mac, but rather provides a means to enter that password automatically after Locket determines certain conditions have been met.</p>
                <p>You understand that Locket has no affiliation with Apple beyond the iOS App Store and its respective policies, and that Apple does not approve of and may in fact disapprove of Locket as a method of authenticating with your Mac. We're not saying they disapprove of it, but just that we make no claims to the contrary.</p>
                <h1>Indemnification</h1>
                <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, our officers, directors, employees, members, shareholders, partners, agents, and suppliers, and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, shareholders, partners, and agents, from any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of Locket or our site, including but not limited to your violation of this agreement. We may, at our sole discretion, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. The assumption of such defense or control by us, however, shall not excuse any of your indemnity obligations.</p>
